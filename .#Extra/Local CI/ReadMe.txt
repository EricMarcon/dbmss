# MHat

If Quantiles is TRUE, Monte-Carlo simulations are run to obtain the distribution of each individual M value under the null hypothesis of random location of points (i.e. all points except for the reference point are relocated).


# rRandomLocation

If ReferencePoint is not NULL, other points are shuffled but the reference point is kept untouched to compute the CI of its local M value.
