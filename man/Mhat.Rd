\description{
  Estimates the \emph{M} function
}
\usage{
Mhat(X, r = NULL, ReferenceType, NeighborType = ReferenceType,
    CaseControl = FALSE, Individual = FALSE, CheckArguments = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{X}{
  A weighted, marked planar point pattern (\code{\link{wmppp.object}}) or a \code{\link{Dtable}} object.
  }
  \item{r}{
  A vector of distances. If \code{NULL}, a default value is set: 64 unequally spaced values are used up to half the maximum distance between points \eqn{d_m}. The first value is 0, first steps are small (\eqn{d_m/800}) then increase progressively up to \eqn{d_m/40}.
  }
  \item{ReferenceType}{
  One of the point types.
  }
  \item{NeighborType}{
  One of the point types. By default, the same as reference type.
  }
  \item{CaseControl}{
  Logical; if \code{TRUE}, the case-control version of \emph{M} is computed. \emph{ReferenceType} points are cases, \emph{NeighborType} points are controls.
  }
  \item{Individual}{
  Logical; if \code{TRUE}, values of the function around each individual point are returned.
  }
  \item{CheckArguments}{
  Logical; if \code{TRUE}, the function arguments are verified. Should be set to \code{FALSE} to save time in simulations for example, when the arguments have been checked elsewhere.
  }
}
\details{
  \emph{M} is a weighted, cumulative, relative measure of a point pattern structure. Its value at any distance is the ratio of neighbors of the \emph{NeighborType} to all points around \emph{ReferenceType} points, normalized by its value over the windows.
  
  If \emph{CaseControl} is \code{TRUE}, then \emph{ReferenceType} points are cases and \emph{NeighborType} points are controls. The univariate concentration of cases is calculated as if \emph{NeighborType} was equal to \emph{ReferenceType}, but only controls are considered when counting all points around cases (Marcon et al., 2012). This makes sense when the sampling design is such that all points of \emph{ReferenceType} (the cases) but only a sample of the other points (the controls) are recorded. Then, the whole distribution of points is better represented by the controls alone.
}
\value{
  An object of class \code{fv}, see \code{\link[spatstat.explore]{fv.object}}, which can be plotted directly using \code{\link[spatstat.explore]{plot.fv}}.
  
  If \code{Individual} is set to \code{TRUE}, the object also contains the value of the function around each individual \emph{ReferenceType} point taken as the only reference point. The column names of the \code{fv} are "M_" followed by the point names, i.e. the row names of the marks of the point pattern.
