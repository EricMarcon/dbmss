\title{
  Estimation of the confidence envelope of the g function under its null hypothesis
}
\description{
    Simulates point patterns according to the null hypothesis and returns the envelope of \emph{g} according to the confidence level.
}
\usage{
gEnvelope(X, r = NULL, NumberOfSimulations = 100, Alpha = 0.05, 
         ReferenceType = "", NeighborType = "", SimulationType = "RandomPosition",
         Global = FALSE, verbose = interactive())
}
\arguments{
  \item{X}{
  A point pattern (\code{\link{wmppp.object}}).
  }
  \item{r}{
  A vector of distances. If \code{NULL}, a sensible default value is chosen (512 intervals, from 0 to half the diameter of the window) following \strong{spatstat}.
  }
  \item{NumberOfSimulations}{
  The number of simulations to run, 100 by default.
  }
  \item{Alpha}{
  The risk level, 5\% by default.
  }
  \item{ReferenceType}{
  One of the point types. Default is all point types.
  }
  \item{NeighborType}{
  One of the point types. Default is all point types.
  }
  \item{SimulationType}{
  A string describing the null hypothesis to simulate. The null hypothesis may be "\emph{RandomPosition}": points are drawn in a Poisson process (default); "\emph{RandomLabeling}": randomizes point types, keeping locations unchanged; "\emph{PopulationIndependence}": keeps reference points unchanged, shifts other point locations.
  }
  \item{Global}{
  Logical; if \code{TRUE}, a global envelope sensu Duranton and Overman (2005) is calculated.
  }
  \item{verbose}{
  Logical; if \code{TRUE}, print progress reports during the simulations.
  }
}
\details{
  This envelope is local by default, that is to say it is computed separately at each distance. See Loosmore and Ford (2006) for a discussion.
  
  The global envelope is calculated by iteration: the simulations reaching one of the upper or lower values at any distance are eliminated at each step. The process is repeated until \emph{Alpha / Number of simulations} simulations are dropped. The remaining upper and lower bounds at all distances constitute the global envelope. Interpolation is used if the exact ratio cannot be reached.
}
\value{
  An envelope object (\code{\link[spatstat.explore]{envelope}}). There are methods for print and plot for this class.
  
  The \code{fv} contains the observed value of the function, its average simulated value and the confidence envelope.
