\title{
  Estimation of the confidence envelope of the M function under its null hypothesis
}
\description{
    Simulates point patterns according to the null hypothesis and returns the envelope of \emph{M} according to the confidence level.
}
\usage{
MEnvelope(X, r = NULL, NumberOfSimulations = 100, Alpha = 0.05,
          ReferenceType, NeighborType = ReferenceType,
          CaseControl = FALSE, SimulationType = "RandomLocation", Global = FALSE,
          verbose = interactive(), parallel = FALSE, parallel_pgb_refresh = 1/10)
}
\arguments{
  \item{X}{
  A point pattern (\code{\link{wmppp.object}}) or a \code{\link{Dtable}} object.
  }
  \item{r}{
  A vector of distances. If \code{NULL}, a default value is set: 32 unequally spaced values are used up to half the maximum distance between points \eqn{d_m}. The first value is 0, first steps are small (\eqn{d_m/200}) then incresase progressively up to \eqn{d_m/20}.
  }
  \item{NumberOfSimulations}{
  The number of simulations to run, 100 by default.
  }
  \item{Alpha}{
  The risk level, 5\% by default.
  }
  \item{ReferenceType}{
  One of the point types.
  }
  \item{NeighborType}{
  One of the point types, equal to the reference type by default to caculate univariate M.
  }
  \item{CaseControl}{
  Logical; if \code{TRUE}, the case-control version of \emph{M} is computed. \emph{ReferenceType} points are cases, \emph{NeighborType} points are controls.
  }
  \item{SimulationType}{
  A string describing the null hypothesis to simulate. The null hypothesis may be
  "\emph{RandomLocation}": points are redistributed on the actual locations (default);
  "\emph{RandomLabeling}": randomizes point types, keeping locations and weights unchanged;
  "\emph{PopulationIndependence}": keeps reference points unchanged, randomizes other point locations.
  }
  \item{Global}{
  Logical; if \code{TRUE}, a global envelope sensu Duranton and Overman (2005) is calculated.
  }
  \item{verbose}{
  Logical; if \code{TRUE}, print progress reports during the simulations.
  }
  \item{parallel}{
  Logical; if \code{TRUE}, simulations can be run in parallel, see details.
  }
  \item{parallel_pgb_refresh}{
  The proportion of simulations steps to be displayed by the parallel progress bar.
  1 will show all but may slow down the computing, 1/100 only one out of a hundred.
  }
}
\details{
  This envelope is local by default, that is to say it is computed separately at each distance.
  See Loosmore and Ford (2006) for a discussion.

  The global envelope is calculated by iteration: the simulations reaching one of the upper or lower values at any distance are eliminated at each step.
  The process is repeated until \emph{Alpha / Number of simulations} simulations are dropped.
  The remaining upper and lower bounds at all distances constitute the global envelope.
  Interpolation is used if the exact ratio cannot be reached.

  Parallel simulations rely on the \emph{future} and \emph{doFuture} packages.
  Before calling the function with argument \code{parallel = TRUE}, you must choose a strategy and set it with \code{\link[future]{plan}}.
  Their progress bar relies on the \emph{progressr} package.
  They must be activated by the user by \code{\link[progressr]{handlers}}.
}
\value{
  An envelope object (\code{\link[spatstat.explore]{envelope}}). There are methods for print and plot for this class.

  The \code{fv} contains the observed value of the function, its average simulated value and the confidence envelope.
