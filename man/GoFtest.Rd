\title{
  Goodness of Fit test between a distance based measure of spatial structure and simulations of its null hypothesis
}
\description{
  Calculates the risk to reject the null hypothesis erroneously, based on the distribution of the simulations.
}
\usage{
GoFtest(Envelope,
        Test = "DCLF",
        Scaling = "Asymmetric",
        Range = NULL,
        Alpha = 0.05,
        CheckArguments = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{Envelope}{
  An envelope object (\code{\link[spatstat.explore]{envelope}}) containing simulations in its \code{simfuns} attribute.
  It may be the result of any estimation function of the dbmss package or obtained by the \code{\link[spatstat.explore]{envelope}} function with argument \code{savefuns=TRUE}.
  }
  \item{Test}{
  A string specifying the method to summarize the deviation from the null hypothesis.
  The deviation may be summarized different ways:
    \itemize{
      \item "DCLF": the integrated squared deviation is utilized, a Diggle-Cressie-Loosmore-Ford test is performed (default);
      \item "Integral": the integrated absolute deviation is utilized;
      \item "MAD": the Maximum Absolute Deviation is utilized, a MAD test is performed.
    }
  }
  \item{Scaling}{
  A string specifying the method to scale the residuals of the test. Scaling may be:
    \itemize{
      \item "Asymmetric": the differences between the 2.5\% lower quantiles of simulations and the expected value is utilized to scale negative residuals, and the differences between the 2.5\% upper quantiles and the expected value is utilized to scale positive residuals (default);
      \item "Quantile": ranges between the 2.5\% upper and 2.5\% lower quantiles is utilized to scale residuals, disregarding whether residuals are negative or positive;
      \item "Studentized": the standard deviation of simulations is utilized.
      \item "None": does not scale residuals.
    }
  }
  \item{Range}{
  A vector of length two containing the minimum and the maximum distance over which to compute the test.
  If \code{NULL}, or if the selected range is outside the simulated distances, all distances in the \code{Envelope} argument are used.
  }
  \item{Alpha}{
  The risk level, 5\% by default.
  }
  \item{CheckArguments}{
  Logical; if \code{TRUE}, the function arguments are verified. Should be set to \code{FALSE} to save time in simulations for example, when the arguments have been checked elsewhere.
  }

\details{
  This function gathers multiple Goodness of Fit tests: the DCLF test (Diggle 1986, Cressie 1993, Loosmore & Ford 2006, Marcon et al. 2012, Myllymäki et al. 2015), the integrated deviation test (Diggle 1979), and the MAD test (Diggle 1979, Myllymäki et al. 2015).

  Monte Carlo simulations assess how well observed distance-based measures of spatial structure align with expected measures under the null hypothesis, estimated here by the mean value of simulations.
  For both observed and simulated measures, residuals — calculated as the differences between observed and expected values — are computed at each distance r.
  These residuals are then transformed into test-specific statistics \emph{u}:
  \itemize{
    \item \code{Test = "MAD"} uses the maximum absolute residual;
    \item \code{Test = "Integral"} and \code{Test = "DCLF"} use residuals to approximate the integrated deviation, and the integrated squared deviation.
  }

  A rank test on \emph{u} evaluates the null hypothesis that the observed point pattern originates from the same point process as the simulations.

  The unequal variance of the residuals at different intervals of r influences \emph{u} statistics, and the power of Goodness of Fit tests.
  Myllymäki et al. (2015) proposed to scale residuals using pointwise quantiles (\code{Scaling = "Asymmetric"}, and \code{Scaling = "Quantile"}), and pointwise standard deviations (\code{Scaling = "Studentized"}).

  Goodness of Fit tests are sensitive to the distance interval over which they are performed.
  It is recommended to choose the distance interval to test based on \emph{a priori} hypotheses (Wiegand & Moloney 2013, Baddeley et al. 2015).
