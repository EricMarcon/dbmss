\title{
  Distance Based Measures of Spatial Structures
}
\description{
  Simple computation of spatial statistic functions of distance to characterize the spatial structures of mapped objects, including classical ones (Ripley's \emph{K} and others) and more recent ones used by spatial economists (Duranton and Overman's \emph{Kd}, Marcon and Puech's \emph{M}). Relies on spatstat for some core calculation.
