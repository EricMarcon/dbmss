The _dbmss_ package allows simple computation of spatial statistic functions of distance to characterize the spatial structures of mapped objects, including classical ones (Ripley's K and others) and more recent ones used by spatial economists (Duranton and Overman's $K_d$, Marcon and Puech's $M$). 
It relies on _spatstat_ for some core calculation.

This vignette contains a quick introduction.

# Data

The main data format is `wmppp` for weighted, marked point pattern.
It inherits from the `ppp` class of the _spatstat_ package.

A `wmppp` object can be created from the coordinates of points, their type and their weight.

```{r wmppp, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library("dbmss")
# Draw the coordinates of 10 points
X <- runif(10)
Y <- runif(10)
# Draw the point types.
PointType   <- sample(c("A", "B"), 10, replace=TRUE)
# Plot the point pattern. Weights are set to 1 ant the window is adjusted
autoplot(wmppp(data.frame(X, Y, PointType)))
```

An example dataset is provided: it is a point pattern from the Paracou forest in French Guiana.
Two species of trees are identified, other trees are of type "Other".
Point weights are their basal area, in square centimeters.

```{r paracou, fig.width=4}
# Plot (second column of marks is Point Types) 
autoplot(paracou16, 
  labelSize = expression("Basal area (" ~cm^2~ ")"), 
  labelColor = "Species")
```

# Main functions

The main functions of the packages are designed to calculate distance-based measures of spatial structure.
Those are non-parametric statistics able to summarize and test the spatial distribution (concentration, dispersion) of points.

The classical, topographic functions such as Ripley's _K_ are provided by the _spatstat_ package and supported by _dbmss_ for convenience.

Relative functions are available in _dbmss_ only.
These are the $M$ and $m$ and $K_d$ functions.

The bivariate $M$ function can be calculated for _Q. Rosea_ trees around _V. Americana_ trees:

```{r m, fig.width=6, fig.height=5}
autoplot(Mhat(paracou16, , "V. Americana", "Q. Rosea"), main="")
```


# Confidence envelopes

Confidence envelopes of various null hypotheses can be calculated.
The univariate distribution of _Q. Rosea_ is tested against the null hypothesis of random location.

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=5}
autoplot(KdEnvelope(paracou16, , ReferenceType="Q. Rosea", Global=TRUE), main="")
```

Significant concentration is detected between about 10 and 20 meters.
