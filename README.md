dbmss is an R package for simple computation of spatial statistic functions of distance to characterize the spatial structures of mapped objects, including classical ones (Ripley's *K* and others) and more recent ones used by spatial economists (Duranton and Overman's *Kd*, Marcon and Puech's *M*). It relies on spatstat for some core calculation.

# Vignettes

A quick [introduction](https://EricMarcon.github.io/dbmss/) is in `vignette("dbmss")`.

A [full documentation](https://ericmarcon.github.io/dbmss/articles/articles/reference.html) is available on the package website.
It is a continuous update of the paper published in the Journal of Statistical Software ([Marcon et al., 2015](https://doi.org/10.18637/jss.v067.c03)).
